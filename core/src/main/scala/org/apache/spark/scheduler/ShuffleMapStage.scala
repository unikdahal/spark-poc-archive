/**
 * ShuffleMapStages are intermediate stages in the execution DAG that produce data for a shuffle.
 * They occur right before each shuffle operation, and might contain multiple pipelined operations
 * before that (e.g. map and filter). When executed, they save map output files that can later be
 * fetched by reduce tasks. The `shuffleDep` field describes the shuffle each stage is part of,
 * and variables like `outputLocs` and `numAvailableOutputs` track how many map outputs are ready.
 *
 * ShuffleMapStages can also be submitted independently as jobs with DAGScheduler.submitMapStage.
 * For such stages, the ActiveJobs that submitted them are tracked in `mapStageJobs`. Note that
 * there can be multiple ActiveJobs trying to compute the same shuffle map stage.

   *
   * This is the crux of avoiding the streaming-writer resubmit hang: if a pipelined shuffle's
   * availability were read from the `MapOutputTracker`, losing an executor that held a completed
   * (already-consumed) pipelined output would strip it there, flip `isAvailable` to false, and make
   * the DAGScheduler resubmit the producer -- whose streaming writer then blocks forever waiting
   * for termination acks from reducers that already finished. Keeping availability local and
   * monotonic means executor loss never triggers such a resubmit; a genuine mid-group failure is
   * handled group-atomically instead. Unused (and empty) for a non-pipelined stage.
